games with python
here I am going to develop the Flappy Bird Game using Python Programming Language.The Flappy Bird game is a very straightforward game.This game has a task record that contains image files, sounds file, and python contents file (flappy.py). we need to install the “pygame” module.
 Pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically intended to help you make games and other multimedia applications.
we need to follow few steps before starting:
Step-1: Type “pip install pygame” in your windows PowerShell or terminal and your “pygame” module will be installed.
Step-2: Type “python” to check which python version you are using. 
Step-3: Type “import pygame” to import pygame.

after this how to create a gaming window for the Flappy Bird game!! Let’s get started with “Pycharm” for making this game...
step-1  open Pycharm as we are going to use Pycharm IDE for making this gaming project.
Step-2: Give any name of your project (Try to avoid giving any module name).
Step-3: Choose “existing interpreter” i.e. I am using Python 3.6 as an existing interpreter. For now try to avoid Virtual environment if you are a beginner and do not know about it.
Step-4: Now Pycharm window will open. Make one new file within the project folder.

##
pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically intended to help you make games and other multimedia applications.
  import pygame
It will import pygame library along with its all existing modules.

   x= pygame.init()
Initializing all modules of pygame

   print(x)
It will print (6,0) which means 6 modules of pygame library are successfully initialized and no (0) module is uninitialized.
